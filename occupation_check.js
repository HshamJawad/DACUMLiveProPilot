// ============================================================
//  occupation_check.js — occupation-title sanity gate
//  DACUM Live Pro
// ------------------------------------------------------------
//  THE PROBLEM
//
//  Every AI path in this app is rooted in one free-text field.
//  The only guard on it was `.trim()` being non-empty, so a
//  single character, a typo, or keyboard noise all passed.
//
//  A language model completes; it does not verify. The generation
//  prompt in projects.js calls the title "BASE CONTEXT" — an
//  assumed fact — and then demands "valid JSON format only". Even
//  if the model doubted the input, we left it no channel to say
//  so: the only permitted output is a duties array. So it builds
//  a plausible chart around whatever it was given.
//
//  The dangerous case is not gibberish. It is the typo that lands
//  on a NEIGHBOURING REAL OCCUPATION — a chart that is internally
//  perfect and about the wrong job, with nothing in it to betray
//  the drift. In a Full Draft that error is the root of a chain
//  seven stages deep and costs the whole daily quota.
//
//  WHAT THIS DOES — AND DELIBERATELY DOES NOT
//
//  One short classification call, before any generation. It never
//  edits the field. A curriculum expert may legitimately enter a
//  local Iraqi trade name the model has not met, and silently
//  replacing that with a "corrected" standard term would destroy
//  their intent with total confidence — worse than the typo.
//  The user decides; this module only asks.
//
//  It FAILS OPEN. If the backend is down, the response is
//  unparseable, or anything else goes wrong, the verdict is
//  `unchecked` and generation proceeds. A sanity check that can
//  block the app when it breaks is a worse liability than the
//  problem it solves.

  return `You are validating a single input field before an occupational
analysis tool generates a DACUM chart from it. You are NOT generating
a chart. Classify the string below and return JSON only.

INPUT STRING: ${JSON.stringify(title)}

WHAT COUNTS AS A VALID OCCUPATION TITLE:
- A recognised occupation, trade, craft or job role, at any skill level.
- Standard-classification names are ideal (Arab Standard Classification
  of Occupations, ISCO-08), but are NOT required.
- Emerging and newly-created occupations are valid when the name is
  clear and aligns with international naming conventions
  (e.g. "Solar PV Installer", "Drone Operator", "Data Annotator").
- Regional, dialect and colloquial trade names ARE VALID when the trade
  is identifiable. A curriculum expert in Iraq or the Gulf may write a
  local name on purpose. Classify these as "known" and put the standard
  equivalent in "standard_name" WITHOUT changing the verdict.
- A title may be in Arabic, French or English regardless of interface
  language. Do not penalise the language of the input.

WHAT IS NOT VALID:
- Misspellings of a real occupation.
- Random characters, keyboard noise, placeholder text ("test", "asdf"),
  single letters, or a lone number.
- Words that are not occupations at all (an object, a place, a company,
  a person's name, a bare sector such as "construction").

VERDICTS — choose exactly one:
  "known"        the string identifies a real occupation.
  "likely_typo"  it is a misspelling of a specific real occupation you
                 can name. Put that occupation in "suggestion".
  "unknown"      not recognisable as any occupation. No suggestion
                 unless you are genuinely confident of one.

RULES:
- Be strict about typos and noise; that is the entire purpose here.
- Be generous about legitimate variety: dialect, emerging occupations
  and non-standard-but-clear names are "known".
- Never invent an occupation to make an input valid.
- "reason" must be ONE short sentence written in ${langName}, addressed
  to the user, explaining the verdict. Omit it when the verdict is
  "known".

Return ONLY this JSON, no prose, no code fences:
{"verdict":"known|likely_typo|unknown","suggestion":"","standard_name":"","reason":""}`;
